I created this project as a freelancer back in College. It was supposed to help a Handicraft manufacturing firm, help keep track of their inventory across different cities. It ultimately got scrapped(although I ended up with half the money!!).
The project is therefore not complete, in the sense that its not a complete ERP systm. The functionalities included however, will work nicely.
Also, partly because I was a naiive college student, and partly because I never got around to ironing out the details, there are many problems associated with the code -- commenting, naming, security measures etc.

The project will however, serve very well for anyone trying to build a basic ERP system.

Its fairly simple to setup. Just put all the files on the server in a folder named "erp". Although you will need to change many a URLs, if you put it on a live server. The code assumes it is being run on a localhost. No SQL server is required. The project uses SQLITE, and all the database files are included here.

Have fun!!
